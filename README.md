# Hi there üëã
I am a ‚òÅÔ∏èCloud Engineer engaging in DevOps practices with affinity for software. My everyday work consists on managing AWS and Kubernetes infrastructure. I enable developers across several teams in hosting and operating their backend and frontend applications at BMW Aftersales. I have 3 years of experience in the professional IT workspace. 

My best achievement yet is [Rito Kids](https://www.ritokids.com/), an EdTech startup which I Co-Founded and which we've built up to 20k+ downloadsüìà. Rito Kids is an educational mobile application which helps children aged 4-8 learn handwriting in a fun, interactive way enabled by complex image processing algorithms.
