# Hi there üëã
I am a ‚òÅÔ∏èCloud Engineer engaging in DevOps practices, with an affinity for software engineering. My everyday work consists of managing AWS and Kubernetes infrastructure. I enable developers across several teams in hosting and operating their backend and frontend applications at BMW Aftersales. With 3 years of professional IT experience, I focus on implementing robust, scalable cloud solutions.

My best achievement yet is [Rito Kids](https://www.ritokids.com/), an EdTech startup which I Co-Founded. The app has gathered up to 20k+ downloadsüìà. Rito Kids is an educational cross-platform mobile application which helps children aged 4-8 learn handwriting in a fun, interactive way enabled by complex image processing algorithms.

My long term goalüî≠ is to become an expert Platform Engineer and specialize in hybrid systems and security, leveraging enterprise cloud solutions in on premise environments.
# Technical Skills üíª
I am a highly technical person. I would say the easiest way to catch my attention is to engage in a discussion about the latest technologies, hardware or methodologies used for hosting and operating whatever kind of software.

I use [neovim](https://neovim.io/) btwüìñ
